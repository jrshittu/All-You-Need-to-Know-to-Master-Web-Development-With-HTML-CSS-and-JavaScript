## CSS Custom Properties and Variables <a name="custom"></a>
**CSS custom properties (aka CSS variables or cascading variables)** allow you to store and reuse values throughout your stylesheet.They act as placeholders for values that can be easily changed in one place, affecting all styles that use them.

**Benefits:**

- **Maintainability:** Reduce code duplication and make your styles more organized and easier to update.
- **Themeability:** Easily switch between different themes by changing only the values of custom properties.
- **Dynamic styles:** Create dynamic styles that react to user interaction or browser features using JavaScript.

**How to use them:**

- 
 **Declare the custom property:**
    - Using two dashes as a prefix (`--variable-name: value;`)
    - Using the `@property` at-rule (`@property --variable-name { syntax: <value-type>; initial-value: value; }`)

- 
 **Use the `var()` function** to access the value (`background-color: var(--primary-color);`)

**Key points:**

- Custom properties are **scoped** to the element(s) they are declared on and participate in the cascade.
- They can be used to store all types of CSS values, including colors, lengths, fonts, and even complex calculations.
- Values can be **overridden** by declarations with higher specificity.
- JavaScript can be used to access and modify custom properties dynamically.

## Use Case: Theme Switching with CSS Custom Properties

Imagine you're building a website with two distinct themes: light and dark. You want to make it easy for users to switch between these themes on the fly.

**Without Custom Properties:**

You would need to duplicate your entire stylesheet, replacing all the color values for each theme. This would lead to a lot of code duplication and make it difficult to maintain.

**With Custom Properties:**

- 
Define custom properties for your primary colors:

![theme.css](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u8gybacfamp67xve2h4k.png)

- 
Use these custom properties throughout your stylesheet:

![custom properties](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o3z8pyrglmlhml627mw3.png)

- 
Create buttons or a toggle to switch the values of the custom properties:

![button](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4268ezzgez5auo4qml1g.png)

By changing the values of just these four custom properties, you can instantly switch the entire theme of your website. This demonstrates the power and flexibility of CSS custom properties.

## CSS Frameworks <a name="frameworks"></a>
CSS frameworks are pre-built collections of CSS styles that provide a solid foundation for web development. They offer pre-defined styles for common elements like buttons, forms, and grids, saving you time and effort.

**Benefits:**

- **Faster development:** Jumpstart your project with ready-made styles and components.
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent design across your website.
- **Responsiveness:** Many frameworks provide responsive design features, making your website look good on all devices.
- **Community and resources:** Access a large community of developers and extensive documentation for support.

**Popular Frameworks:**

- **Bootstrap:** Widely used, mobile-first framework with a vast library of components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first framework for building custom designs with low-level classes.
- **Material Design:** Google's framework based on their design principles, offering a clean and modern aesthetic.
- **Foundation:** Flexible framework with a focus on accessibility and modularity.
- **Bulma:** Lightweight and minimalist framework with a focus on simplicity.

**Choosing a Framework:**

Consider your project needs, desired level of customization, and team experience when choosing a framework.

**Key Points:**

- Frameworks can simplify development but may add complexity and bloat to your code.
- Learn the framework's core principles to leverage its full potential.
- Customize the framework to suit your specific needs and brand identity.

## Bootstrap <a name="bootstrap"></a>
**Quickstart**
Skip the setup, jumpstart your web project with Bootstrap's CDN!

- 
Create a new index.html file in your project directory and create the basic boilerplate.

![index](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgo2v6tbp4esky73iwmc.png)

- 
Include Bootstrap's `.min.css` in your `<head>` for styling and Add Bootstrap's `.bundle.min.js` before closing `<body>` for interactivity (includes Popper for dropdowns etc.).
